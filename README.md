# In network bot traffic analysis
<p>
Malicious bots can cause several issues, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, generating fake news, web scrapings, or shilling attacks in recommender systems.

 We evaluated a potential vulnerability within in-network caching systems. As depicted, regular users typically request popular items, leading to the storage of these items within the in-network caching system. However, malicious bots follow a different pattern, actively soliciting less popular items and
attempting to inject counterfeit popular items into the caching system.

<p>We conducted an analysis on several pre-existing datasets such as Twibot-20 [1], bot-net [2], Wikimedia API [3], Amazon [3], and Alibaba benchmark generator [4]. However, these datasets did not meet our criteria due to either lacking sufficient annotations or lacking essential query and user information. As a result, we conducted a thorough review, which encompassed an analysis
of the characteristics of the web requests [5], web traffic [6], workload [7], bot traffic [8], and network caches [9]. Then,
we formulated a set of guiding principles for the precise generation of a bot traffic dataset. The following are the key
principles we adhered to during the dataset creation process:

1- Search queries made by bots are often long search queries and tend to search for not so popular items in the e-commerce search engine [10]. 

2- User requests follow a Zipfian distribution [11]. This observation signifies that specific segments of the data experience
a higher volume of requests, a pattern that evolves over time.

3- The average time interval between consecutive requests made by bots is five times shorter than normal users [12].
